TASK 1 - EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING 

 Introduction 


In today’s world, email has become a crucial way for people to communicate. Spam is those annoying emails we didn’t ask for, like ads or scams, that fill up our email inboxes and that is sent to a massive number of users at one time. In this Project,use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Let’s get started!

 Features 
 
Utilizes Python for building the email spam detector. Applies machine learning algorithms for training and classification. Implements label encoding to transform categorical data. Uses Logistic Regression for the classification task. Allows for custom prediction inputs.

 Installation 
 
To run the email spam detector, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

•Python 3.x
•numpy
•pandas
•scikit-learn

TASK -2  IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Introduction 

This repository contains the code for training a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on their measurements. The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, each having distinct measurement characteristics. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify Iris flowers based on their measurements.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris flower dataset, which is commonly used for classification tasks. It includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 Iris flowers, with 50 samples for each species. The dataset is available in the repository as iris.csv.

Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

*NumPy
*Pandas
*Seaborn
*Matplotlib
*Model Training

Three different models are trained:

*Support Vector Machine (SVM)
*Logistic Regression
*Decision Tree Classifier
*Each model is trained using the Iris flower dataset and evaluated for its accuracy

Testing

After training the models, a new test dataset is used to assess their performance. The test dataset contains measurements of Iris flowers with unknown species. The trained models predict the species of these flowers, and their accuracy is evaluated.
